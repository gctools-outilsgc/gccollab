# GCcollab

[GCcollab](https://gccollab.ca/) is a professional networking and collaborative workspace allowing people to connect and share information, leveraging the power of networking towards a more effective and efficient public service.

Hosted by the Government of Canada, GCcollab is open to all Canadian public servants, academics and post-secondary students, as well as partners by invitation.

It features dynamic online communities where public servants can collaborate on projects, blog, chat via instant messaging, carry on discussions, ask and answer each other's questions about anything from learning to technology. It acts as a professional platform to create your professional C.V., share ideas and connect you with people and information that you need.

GCcollab is based on GCconnex - https://github.com/gctools-outilsgc/gcconnex - which is based on the open source project Elgg - https://github.com/Elgg/Elgg
